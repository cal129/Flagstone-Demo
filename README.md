# Mindful Summit

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this project, Mindful Summit, is to design a calming, accessible, and beginner‑friendly website that helps users explore practical mental health tips in a supportive environment. By combining a nature‑inspired visual theme with clear navigation and diverse, inclusive imagery, the site aims to reduce barriers to accessing mental health information. It provides simple guidance on everyday practices such as mindfulness, sleep, physical activity, and gratitude, while also connecting users to trusted external resources and support networks. Ultimately, the project seeks to create a positive user experience that empowers individuals to recognize common challenges, manage stress, and take small, meaningful steps toward wellbeing.
